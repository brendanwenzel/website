# Portfolio

Over my 16+ year career, I've helped numerous clients achieve significant growth through strategic digital marketing initiatives. Here are some of my most notable projects and achievements.

## Cute n' Country (2013-2020)

**Founder**

Founded in the fall of 2013, Cute n' Country tapped into a niche market of country lifestyle enthusiasts.

### Key Achievements:
- Scaled from first sale to six-figure profit months within 6 months
- Managed nearly $3 million in ad spend across Google, Pinterest, and Facebook
- Grew an aggregated following of over 3 million subscribers
- Successfully exited through acquisition in May 2020

### Growth Strategy:
My approach combined organic social media growth with strategic paid advertising to build a passionate community around the brand. By focusing on relatable content and shareable memes, we created strong brand resonance with our core audience of middle-aged women interested in country lifestyle.

## Client Success: Revenue Growth (2020-2023)

**Marketing Consultant**

During a three-year contract, I was directly responsible for generating substantial revenue growth for a client.

## Facebook Advertising Optimization (2023)

**Senior Media Buyer**

For a client with an established Facebook ad account, I optimized and scaled their campaigns.

### Key Achievements:
- Scaled daily spend from $1,300/day to $5,000/day in just 22 days
- Simultaneously improved two core KPIs, enhancing both volume and efficiency
- Implemented systematic media buying strategies that delivered consistent results

## Technical Projects

Using ethers.js and Hardhat, I created a solution to recover over $2,000 of liquidity locked by a token developer in a rug pull.

### E-commerce Conversion Optimization
Implemented cart upgrade offers that added $52.63 per checkout by optimizing product bundles and user experience.

## Current Projects
