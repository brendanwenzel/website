# Media Buying

As a seasoned media buying professional with experience across multiple platforms, I help brands optimize their ad spend and maximize ROI through strategic campaign management.

## Platforms I Specialize In

- **TikTok**: Leveraging TikTok's growing social commerce capabilities
- **Amazon**: Optimizing product visibility and sales through Amazon's advertising solutions
- **YouTube**: Creating compelling video ad campaigns that drive engagement
- **Facebook/Instagram**: Managing high-performance campaigns that deliver results
- **Google Ads**: Strategic keyword targeting and campaign optimization

## My Media Buying Philosophy

My approach to media buying is systematic and data-driven. I've developed proprietary methodologies like my "5x20 method" that consistently delivers results even under pressure. Through years of testing and optimization, I've built reliable systems that:

- Lower downside risk while keeping upside potential
- Scale campaigns effectively when they're performing well
- Maintain consistent ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
- Adapt quickly to platform changes and market conditions

## Track Record

I've personally managed millions in ad spend across multiple platforms:

- Helped clients achieve 4x revenue growth through strategic media buying
- Generated over $1 million in personal profit from Facebook campaigns
- Scaled accounts from $1,300/day to $5,000/day while improving core KPIs
- Successfully competed against "big name gurus" in head-to-head competitions

## Ideal Clients

My media buying services are best suited for:
- E-commerce brands looking to scale customer acquisition
- Businesses with existing marketing funnels seeking optimization
- Companies with a minimum ad spend of $100/day
- Organizations ready to implement strategic, systematic approaches to media buying
