# Web Development

I combine technical expertise with marketing knowledge to build web solutions that don't just look good but drive business results.

## Development Skills

I offer development services in multiple technologies:

- **E-commerce**: Shopify development and optimization
- **Blockchain**: Smart contract development using Solidity
- **Backend**: Server-side programming with Rust and other languages
- **Custom Solutions**: SaaS development and custom software
- **Marketing Tech**: Integration of analytics and marketing tools

## Client Success Stories

### Blockchain Recovery Case

I used my technical skills with ethers.js and Hardhat to recover over $2,000 in liquidity that had been locked by a token developer during a rug pull. By analyzing the blockchain transactions and creating a custom solution, I was able to recover funds that would have otherwise been lost.

### E-commerce Optimization

For multiple e-commerce clients, I've implemented technical solutions that have significantly improved performance:

- Created cart upgrade offers that added $52.63 per checkout
- Developed bundle strategies that maintained profit while improving conversion
- Implemented technical solutions to improve site speed and user experience

## My Technical Approach

My approach to development is pragmatic and results-focused:

1. **Understand the Business Goals**: Every technical solution starts with understanding what problem we're solving
2. **Build for Results**: Focus on creating solutions that directly impact key business metrics
3. **Integrate Marketing & Tech**: Bridge the gap between technical implementation and marketing strategy
4. **Measure & Optimize**: Continuous improvement based on data and performance

## Who This Is For

My web development services are ideal for:
- E-commerce businesses looking to optimize their online stores
- Companies exploring blockchain technologies and Web3 applications
- Businesses requiring custom software solutions with marketing integration
- Startups and established companies needing technical expertise combined with marketing knowledge
